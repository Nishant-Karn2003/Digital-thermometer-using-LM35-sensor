# Digital Thermometer using LM35 Sensor and Arduino  

## ðŸ“Œ Overview  
This project implements a simple **digital thermometer** using an **LM35 temperature sensor** and an **Arduino microcontroller**. The LM35 provides an analog voltage proportional to temperature, which the Arduino processes and displays on a **16x2 LCD screen** or via the serial monitor.  

The design is **low-cost, accurate, and power-efficient**, making it suitable for applications such as home automation, weather monitoring, healthcare, and industrial control.

## ðŸ›  Components Required  
- Arduino (Uno/Nano/MEGA)  
- LM35 Temperature Sensor  
- 16x2 LCD Display (I2C or direct pin connection)  
- Breadboard & Jumper Wires  
- 5V DC Power Supply  
- Optional: Buzzer for alerts  

---

## âš¡ Working Principle  
- The **LM35 outputs 10mV per Â°C**.  
- Arduino reads this voltage from the sensor pin and converts it into temperature (Â°C).  
- Temperature values are displayed on the LCD/serial monitor.  
- An optional buzzer can be triggered if the temperature exceeds a threshold.
